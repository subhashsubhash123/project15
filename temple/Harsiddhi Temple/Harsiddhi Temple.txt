Harsiddhi Temple

The temple was reconstructed during the Maratha period and the two pillars adorned with lamps are special features of Maratha art. These lamps lit during Navaratri, present a glorious spectacle. There is an ancient well on the premises, and an artistic pillar adorns the top of it.It is said that the original temple at the hill was constructed by Lord Krishna himself after Goddess Amba helped him defeat demon Jarasandha. When Lord Krishna succeeded in killing Jarasandha, the Yadavs were left overjoyed and since then, Goddess Harsiddhi is worshipped as the kuldevi of the Yadavs in the region.
