Bada Ganpati Temple

Legends say that one of the residents of the city of Avantika or Ujjain dreamt of Lord Ganpati and he rose up the next day and made the statue of Bada Ganpati in order to seek favour from him. Built in 1875, the temple is located at the western end of the Mahatma Gandhi road in Indore.
